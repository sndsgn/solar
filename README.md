###COULD LOS ANGELES GENERATE ITS ENERGY FROM SOLAR?

An API driven exploration into answering whether Los Angeles could generate its energy from solar panels. This project is trying to answer questions such as:

- How many solar panels would be needed to cover Los Angeles' electricity needs?
- What is the cost of the solar panels needed to create that electricity?
- How soon could the project be paid off as far as savings from solar energy generation?
- What are the benefits? 

####What this info does not consider:
- The tax credits or discounts on panels for buying them in volume
- The additional costs beyond the solar panels to install solar systems
